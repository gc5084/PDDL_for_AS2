# PDDL_for_AS2
this is the code for Assigment 2 of Autonomous Systems 

The problem is the following: we have an agent moving around in a n x n grid. The grid also contains a certain number of keys plus a certain number of lock boxes.
Both keys and lock boxes can be green, blue or red, and a given key can only open a lock box that has the same color. The agent can also move around the grid, and pick up and drop keys at will, but can only hold two keys at any given time. Whenever the agent opens a door, the key stays in the lock "automatically". The agent starts the problem in one corner of the grid, and no key at all in her hands. The goal of the agent is to unlock all boxes and return to the initial position.
